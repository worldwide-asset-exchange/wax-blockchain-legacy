## Welcome to the WAX Source Code Repository!
This software enables businesses to rapidly build and deploy high-performance and high-security blockchain-based applications. For developer tips and tutorials, refer to our [WAX Blockchain Developer Hive](https://developer.wax.io/).

The Worldwide Asset eXchange™ (WAX) is a purpose-built blockchain and protocol token designed to make e-commerce transactions faster, easier, and safer for all participants. The WAX Blockchain mainnet uses Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) as its consensus mechanism and is fully backward compatible with EOS. The custom features and incentive mechanisms developed by WAX are designed to optimize the blockchain’s usability in e-commerce, and encourage voting on guilds and proposals.

WAX is creating a suite of blockchain-based tools upon which dApps, marketplaces, and native non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are built. These tools include services to support e-commerce operations such as an interactive block explorer, wallet, SSO and OAUTH, item creation, an RNG service, interactive item viewers, marketplace creation, and more. The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that is extremely fast (500 millisecond block times), fee-less for customers and less expensive for developers, and leverages voting rewards to incentivize participation in the selection of block producers and proposals.

### Some of the features of WAX Blockchain include:
1. [Token Swap in conjunction with Genesis Block Member Rewards](https://wax.io/blog/introducing-the-genesis-block-member-program-join-and-receive-daily-token-rewards-for-3-years)
2. [Earning staking rewards](https://wax.io/blog/earn-more-wax-introducing-wax-block-rewards-staking-and-voting-guilds-and-more)
3. [Incentives and mechanics to address voter apathy](https://wax.io/blog/staking-and-voting-on-wax-a-technical-deep-dive?)
4. [Random Number Generator Native Blockchain Service](https://wax.io/blog/how-the-wax-rng-smart-contract-solves-common-problems-for-dapp-developers)
5. [WAX Account - Account Creation, Voting, Token Swap, and Balances](https://wax.io/blog/a-sneak-peek-of-wax-account-features)
6. [Integrated with the OPSkins customer base (and other reasons to run dApps on WAX)](https://wax.io/blog/the-top-10-reasons-to-run-dapps-on-wax)

These features are in addition to the benefits you will find on [EOSIO](https://github.com/EOSIO). The WAX Blockchain is a variant of EOSIO (see [WAX_RELEASE_NOTES.md](WAX_RELEASE_NOTES.md) for details).

WAX is released under the open source MIT license and is offered “AS IS” without warranty of any kind, express or implied. Any security provided by the WAX software depends in part on how it is used, configured, and deployed.

There is no public testnet running currently.
### Installation Instructions

You have several ways to run a node and develop smart contracts on the WAX Blockchain:
1. Use our [production docker images](https://cloud.docker.com/u/waxteam/repository/docker/waxteam/production). This is the official and recommended way, also the faster one, you can run a node in seconds. See the [mainnet sample](https://github.com/worldwide-asset-exchange/wax-blockchain/tree/develop/samples/mainnet) for more information.
2. Complete our [Docker Quickstart](https://developer.wax.io/dapps/docker-quickstart/). You can also find WAX tutorials in the [dApp Development](https://developer.wax.io/dapps/) section of the [WAX Blockchain Developer Hive](https://developer.wax.io/).
3. Currently, we are not providing pre-compiled packages. Therefore, if you can't use our Docker images, you will have to compile the source code and install it with the following instructions:

**Note:** Building from source is not supported. We recommend using our [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/u/waxteam) instead. 

```console

$ git clone https://github.com/worldwide-asset-exchange/wax-blockchain.git
$ cd wax-blockchain
$ git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build (and set the installation directory)
$ ./wax_build.sh -i ~/wax-blockchain

# This will install the blockchain in the previously set installation directory
$ ./wax_install.sh

# Optional: Add the blockchain to your path (it requires a console relogin)
echo "export PATH=~/wax-blockchain/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc

```
If you have previously installed *wax-blockchain*, please run the *wax_uninstall* script (it is in the directory where you cloned *wax-blockchain*).

#### Troubleshooting
